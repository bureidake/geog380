Solutions and links for the following:
Worksheet 1: 

- To calculate the mean center it is similar calculate mean except we are calculating two times one for the (x) coordinates and one for the (y).
- Calculate all of the (x) divided by the # of (x)s for example to find the mean of (1,2,3,4,5) => it is "(1+2+3+4+5) / 5" because 
 there are 5 elements and that's how you calculate the mean. 
- Apply for the (x),(y) therefore, the formula for mean center: 
                        
                        mean center(mean(x),mean(y)) 

- For number 2 of worksheet 1:
