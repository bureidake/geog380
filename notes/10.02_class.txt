Borders
A border may help to draw together the elements on the map
Frame line – serves as a picture frame surrounding everything in the map
Neat line – sometimes used to outline the actual map content within the entire map
Borders should be subtleand not distract
Thin blackor grey line often good choice


Alignment – Sight lines
Sight lines are invisible horizontal and vertical lines
Reducing the number of sight lines, reduces complexity


General layout – eye movement
In generalFrom top to bottom
From left to right
Position map elements accordingly to tell your “story” efficiently


General layout – visual center
The visual center is located slightly above the actual center
Centering implies "importance"


Group Activity
Form a group with 2~3 of your neighbors
Find one good example and one bad example for visual center and eye movement in mapping
Share your findings with other group
