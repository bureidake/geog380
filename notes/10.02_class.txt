Borders
A border may help to draw together the elements on the map
Frame line – serves as a picture frame surrounding everything in the map
Neat line – sometimes used to outline the actual map content within the entire map
Borders should be subtleand not distract
Thin blackor grey line often good choice


Alignment – Sight lines
Sight lines are invisible horizontal and vertical lines
Reducing the number of sight lines, reduces complexity


General layout – eye movement
In generalFrom top to bottom
From left to right
Position map elements accordingly to tell your “story” efficiently


General layout – visual center
The visual center is located slightly above the actual center
Centering implies "importance"


Group Activity
Form a group with 2~3 of your neighbors
Find one good example and one bad example for visual center and eye movement in mapping
Share your findings with other group

Design evaluation
Gestalt principles in map design
Map Composition


Map Aesthetics
c A R T o g r a p h y
“Maps should have harmony within themselves.  An ugly map,   with crude colors, careless line work, and disagreeable, poorly arranged lettering may be intrinsically as accurate as a beautiful map, but it is less likely to inspire confidence.”   John  K. Wright

Bad maps vs. Incorrect maps
Good design = Harmony+ Composition+ Clarity

Note*** it is better to give the audience bad map than a incorrectmap, because incorrect map can get you in trouble

talt Principles for visual perception
The meaning of graphic symbols as “unified whole” ,  or a visual group

Examples of Gestalt map activity

ap Composition
A thematic map can be considered to be a composition of   levels (hierarchy between layers)
Each level contains one or more design elements
The arrangement of elements at each level is called planar organization
The arrangement between levels is called hierarchical organization,  or visual hierarchy (in the order of importance

isual Hierarchy
The intellectual plan for the map andeventually a graphicsolution that satisfies the plan
A guidelinetoorganize map elements in the hierarchy

Figure-Ground Organization
A way of organizing perception into a hierarchy of figures and grounds
Figures: things that are more important and dominating
Ground: things that are less important
