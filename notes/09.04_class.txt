Numeric summaries
Understand mode, mean, median. z scores.

---------
Two types stats:
-Discriptive
..reducing lots of data
.. e.g. shorelines, generalization (data generalization), simplification

-Inferential
.. conclusions can be drawn with limited information
.. samples of population
.. e.g. sampling, geostatistics

---------
Measures of central tendency

---------
Outliers ***** (subject for presentation)
- extreme value a long way from the mean and median
- distrubution
..data spread, variation, dispersion
...ranges, quantiles, inter-quantile ranges (IQR)

---------
Ranges examples

Stem-and-leaf plot:graphicall summary
-Visual memory, without too much graphical efforts
-rough idea of the whole data

0 | 4389823426
1 | 47589345928345
2 | 343326346234623462346
3 | 23235

e.g. 3 | 23235 equals 32,33,32,33,35

-Stem an leaf plot histogram. figure examples

-------
Histogram
-recap
-measure the distance/height of the graphs
..divide the range of the data to series of equal intervals
..
..
breakpoints eg. 0 c degrees, 50%, pH7
-no overlaps ranges are not unbalanced.
